### LordBlacky

I am studying computer science and use this blog to share and document
some of my projects, experiences and interesting discoveries.

I am most interested in neural networks and, more recently,
processors and virtual machines.

The main purpose of this blog is to document my projects and
their progress, as it helps me to get a cleaner project 
flow and more structure into the projects.
And it may also help others.
